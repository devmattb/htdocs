# htdocs
My PHP Built Website

# Get Started (Windows):

## Install XAMPP:
Download XAMPP with PHP version 7+ on this website:
https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

## Clone down the project in the correct directory:
Once XAMPP is installed, download or clone this repository to the xampp folder, on disk where you
installed XAMPP. By default this is: "C:/xampp/"

## Set up the database:
In this repository there is a folder called "sql". Please follow the instructions in that
README file to set up the database correctly before continuing.

## Open the XAMPP Control panel.
Search your computer for "XAMPP", or find the XAMPP Control Panel Application where
you installed XAMPP.

## Run the program:
If you haven't started "MySQL" and "Apache" in the XAMPP Control Panel already, please do so now.
You can find the "MySQL" and "Apache" Modules to the very left side of the XAMPP control panel.

## Open the website in a browser:
The website/program is now up and running. By default it is running on port 80.
Please visit the website on your desired browser, on the address:
http://www.localhost:80/

If you have Skype running, it may interfere with port 80 and you may run in to errors.
Please close Skype if that is the case.

If for some reason this still isn't working, please retrace your steps in this README
file.

If all else fails, check if the default port is 80 for you. It might not be.

You can always contact @devmattb, the main developer of this project, if you run
in to issues that you are not able to solve yourself.

You can find @devmattb's contact details on his Github, or his website:
